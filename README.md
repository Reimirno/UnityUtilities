# Unity Utility Scripts

My utility scripts that I import to every single Unity project. This repo would be constantly updated.

Just download and copy files you think you need to your project folder. Zero integration effort needed.

## Content

- Script template
- IEnumerable extension methods (e.g. print a list without foreach)
- Better debug
